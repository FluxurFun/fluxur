# Fluxur

Fluxur is a protocol designed to make commitment provable, time-based, and publicly verifiable on-chain.

Instead of relying on promises, social signals, or off-chain agreements, Fluxur enables creators to demonstrate long-term alignment through irreversible on-chain actions.

## Overview

Fluxur provides infrastructure for:
- Time-based creator fee locks
- Public, on-chain commitment verification
- Transparent alignment between creators and communities

Fluxur is non-custodial and does not guarantee outcomes. It provides primitives that allow commitment to be demonstrated through code.

## Status

Fluxur is live on mainnet.  
The protocol and ecosystem are under active development.
